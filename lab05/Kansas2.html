            <h3>We did at the time see a Turtle</h3>
            <p>
                We saw said Turtle in the afternoon. I'd say it was a fairly decent turtle if you ask me. Here's a picture.

            <p>So yeah this is said turtle, we named it Franklin.</p>
            
            <h3>We built a Church this afternoon</h3>
            <p>
                We built a church shortly after we saw Franklin. I'd say it was a pretty Holy Church if you ask me. Here's a Pic.
