        <h3>What is Jeff and Friends Make Things?</h3>
        <p>Jeff and friends is a site made as a safe haven to creaters, painters, drawers, crafters, designers, woodworkers, and anything else related to making things. 
            Jeff and friends is a site that displays the works of these "Creaters" regardless of whether the works are professionally done or just as a hobby. 
            Many "Friends" of the site are non-art majors and just enjoy spending their free time making beautiful things.
            Jeff himself isn't an art major either but believes it is important to get more creative and create things with our hand rather than just buying anything that we need.
            In a world that is growing increasingly dependent on products and services made by big corporations, Jeff would like to see a little bit more self reliance.
            No matter who you are, if you feel like posting your piece on this sight, feel free to contact us and we will do our best to get it up for all the world to see.
            If you don't feel like posting, still feel free to look around an maybe become a bit inspired by what you see.

        <h3>Jeff and Friend's Goal</h3>
        <p>Jeff and Friend's Goal is to get more people involved in art, regardless of if they consider themselves an artist or not.
            Jeff hopes that the art on here might inspire artist of the future to get more involved in creating things. 
            In addition Jeff is always welcome to new friends and encurages people to get in contact if they wish to have their works displayed.
            None of the works we have on this site are for sale and are owned only by the artists that created them, and are not made to be sold or put into circulation on sites other than this one.
