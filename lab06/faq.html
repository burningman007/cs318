    <h3>
        My Windows 7 product key won't verify. What's the problem?
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
        The most common issue is the use of a product key for a product not currently supported by the site such as an Upgrade key, an MSDN key, product keys for pre-installed media or an Enterprise edition key. For access to MSDN products or Enterprise edition visit the MSDN Portal or the Volume Licensing Service Center. Upgrades and pre-installed media are not currently supported by the tools on the site.
        If you believe you have a valid product key and are still receiving an error, please contact Support.

        I bought Windows 7 through a website. After talking to the merchant, I was told I had a "system builder" product key. Why doesn't that work?
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
        Not all “system builder” products for Windows 7 are currently available on the site. We are working to add more, but for now, we suggest you contact Support.

        I purchased my copy of Windows through a university. Can I download it here?
    </h3>
    <p class="answer">
        Yes, but you’ll need your product key. Go to the Academic Products download page and select the version of Windows to begin.
