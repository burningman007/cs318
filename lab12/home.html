            <div> this pizza is real good try it!Use background colors to make it appear that the left column stretches all the way down to the footer, though in reality the nav will be much shorter than the main content and footer.
                    Add a div with an id of order. Give it fixed positioning and a background image of a pizza. Make sure the pizza image itself has a transparent background. (Perhaps this one?) Adjust the width and height of the div and background image to consume just a small portion of the page. Make this pizza always appear in one of the corners of the browser window, even if the viewer has scrolled down. Test this by adding dummy text to fill up your page and shrinking your browser window so the scrollbars appear.</div>
